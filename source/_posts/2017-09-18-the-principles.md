> Some people get iver the ego barrier and others don't.

> As I mentioned before, I believe that life consists of an enormous number of choices that comes at us and that each decision we make has consequences, **so the quality of our lives depends on the quality of the we make.**

> reality + dreams + determination = a successful life

> What is essential is that you are claer about what you want and that you figure out how to get it.
